	 * Using @Retry is great if we have small number of requests that might fail.
	 * 
	 * Using @CircuitBreaker is for when there are wayy too many requests that keep failing, 
	 * and we dont have enough time to process a response from the fallbackMethod.
	 * 
	 * What it does is, it stores the fallbackMethod response after a few failures
	 * and keeps on sending that response without actually calling the fallbackMethod.
	 * So, it breaks the failing Circuit & directly returns the response back.
	 * 
	 * Using @RateLimiter, we can specify how many requests we want to allow in how many seconds.
	 * eg: in 10s, only allow 2 calls to the sample-api

	/*
	 * 3 different states of a @CircuitBreaker : 
	 * 
	 * 1. CLOSED 	: The M.S that is down keeps on getting called, always, on each attempt.
	 * 2. OPEN 		: The @CircuitBreaker does not call the M.S that is down, it directly returns the fallback Response.
	 * 3. HALF-OPEN : The @CircuitBreaker send only a % of requests to the M.S 
	 * 					and returns the hardcoded fallback Response for rest of the calls.
	 * 
	 * The @CircuitBreaker switches into different states depending on failure rate and its threshold.
